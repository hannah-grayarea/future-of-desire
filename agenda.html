    </header>

    <div class="intro">
        This colloquium will convene scholars and curators for two days of presentation and discussion on May 17 and 18, 2025. The first session (on May 17) will feature an introduction by Hannah Scott, followed by presentations from colloquium participants who will connect their research or areas of interest to the Youngblood archives. Three keynote presentations will close out the day. The second session (on May 18) will consist of roundtable discussion focused primarily on Youngblood's unpublished Future of Desire manuscript and its connections to, or departures from, other artistic perspectives on the evolution of communications technologies. Following the second session will be a public screening of alternative video and television works that instantiate some of the ideals Youngblood espouses in his post-Expanded Cinema writing.
